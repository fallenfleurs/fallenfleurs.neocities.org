            <div class="entry scroll">
            <p>I've been pretty radio silent, and why do you ask? Because not only did i end up in the ER again, but i've also been taking the time to learn and make the full switch over to linux. I am sick and tired of windows bullshit, and it's not getting any better. I feel so much better being on linux now. â™¡ </p>
            
            <p> No joke it is for sure a learning curve! But it is definitely worth learning. I know i've gotten upset, or frustrated whenever something might not of gone right, but I was determined, because I know i've had my frustrations with windows, and for more than just: 'human error on my part'. Windows is making it all the more incredibly unsafe to use, and I just hope that linux continues to improve so that way more peopel can leave windows. Because it's future is pretty bleak... </p>

            <h2><span>Am I a bad wife?</span><time>November 02, 2024</time></h2>
            <div class="entry">
            <p>Hey guys, sooooo like... I am not sure if I am a good wife or not. But today my husband had gotten a call from someone within the Post Office chain, and the job he had applied for ASAP, the one that we have been waiting to hear back from for awhile. The one they said was first come first served. Well, he was told that they offered the job to some other lady, even though she already has so many other office offerings that have been given to her. I really hope that she doesn't take his position. We really need this, HE really needs this, for his mental health especially and even physical health.</p> 
            
            <p>Now onto why I felt like an awful failure of a wife? I often try to comfort through doing dumb things, or trying to see the better side of things. And last night I think i just wasn't sure how to cope with the fact that I felt like i wasn't getting through to him at all... After awhile we talked things out and everything is fine, but i just worry... I only want him to be happy, genuinely. And i only want us to be financially secure, I've never had stability in my whole life and i guess i just get.. scared?? Idk... We'll just see what happens.</p>
